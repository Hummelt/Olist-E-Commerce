## Business Understanding of Olist E-Commerce
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on Olist's website: www.olist.com

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

## Data Understanding 
The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization:

## Prepare Data

The following steps have been processed in this analysis:

- Understanding the dataset
- Checking for missing values 
- Checking for duplicates
- Checking data formats


## Data Moddeling

- Combining data sets
- Checking for correlations
- 

## Questions of the Analysis
With the Analysis of this dataset we want to develop and resolve some logistical point: 
  - Are deliveries on time (or earlier than the expected delivery date)?
  - What does the order profile look like?
  - What correlations can we find regarding the item price?

Further this analysis should be an example on how to analyze (multiple datasets) on the one hand and on the other hand explain every step to everybody out there who is just starting to become a Parselmouth.
