### Analysing of the E-Commerce company Olist dataset

## Olist E-Commerce
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on Olist's website: www.olist.com

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

## Dataset
The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization:

## Analysis
With the Analysis of this dataset we want to develop and resolve:

- A "How to start the analysis"
- A "How to prepare your dataset(s)"
- A "How to explore the data"

Logistical point of view: 
  - What does the SKU profile looks like?
  - What does the order profile look like?
  - Can we derive any correlation of products that will be likely ordered together?

Further this analysis should be an example on how to analyze (multiple datasets) on the one hand and on the other hand explain every step to everybody out there who is just starting to become a Parselmouth.
